# Labuniformdetect
A python code
<br>
Using open cv and pre-trained yolov8 model to detect lab uniforms of students of MVJ college.
<br>
This project aims to detect whether individuals are wearing a specific college uniform using Python and OpenCV. It uses image processing techniques to identify color patterns (e.g., dark blue shirts and pants) and optionally match the college logo. The goal is to classify uniform compliance in surveillance or entry systems.

Tech Stack:
<br>
Python
<br>
OpenCV
<br>
Custom dataset (images of uniforms & logo)
<br>

Work in progress â€” currently focused on preprocessing and color-based detection.
